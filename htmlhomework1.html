        <h1>Passage 1: How the Moon Was Kind to Her Mother</h1>
        <br>
                <ol>
         <li>Once upon a time, a long while ago, the Sun, the Wind, and the
            Moon were three sisters, and their mother was a pale, lovely Star that
            shone, far away, in the dark evening sky.
        </li>
        <br>
            <li>One day their uncle and aunt, Thunder and Lightning, asked the
                three sisters to have supper with them, and their mother said that they
                might go. She would wait for them, she said, and would not set until all
                three returned and told her about their pleasant visit.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>So the Sun, the Wind, and the Moon started out for the party with
                the Thunder and Lightning. Oh, it was a supper to remember! The table
                was spread with a cloth of rainbow. There were ices like the snow on
                the mountain tops, cakes as soft and white as clouds, and fruits from
                every quarter of the earth. The three sisters ate their fill, especially the
                Sun and the Wind, who were very greedy and left not so much as a
                crumb on their plates. But the Moon was kind and remembered her
                mother. She hid a part of her supper in her long white fingers to take
                home and share with her mother, the Star.
            </li>     
        </ol>
